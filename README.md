# vulnerable-code-samples
This repository is simply a collection of vulnerable code snippets for penetration testers to practice their abilities on.

Being able to successfully exploit vulnerable software is an indispensable skill. However, many penetration testers don't understand what is really happening when they exploit an application. This repository gives penetration testers the opportunity to understand what is happening at the code level as well as practice new exploitation techniques. 

This repository contains code snippets from a variety of different languages and vulnerability classifications.

  -Cryptogrpahy based vulnerabilities
  
  -Web applications vulnerabilities
  
  -Compiled language vulnerabilities
  
  -Scripting language vulnerabilties
  
  More than the above is yet to be added to the repository, but for now, I hope you enjoy what we have to offer!
